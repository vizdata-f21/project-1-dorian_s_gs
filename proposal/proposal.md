This dataset is created by FiveThirtyEight, originally collected through
superbowl-ads.com. There are 247 different commercials with 25 different
variables, including the year, brand, and view count. However, they only
take from 10 different brands for their dataset. Their purpose for
creating this dataset is to identify defining characteristics of
superbowl ads from popular brands like Toyota and Bud Light. Some
questions they asked included; Was it funny? Was it patriotic? Did it
include animals? Did it use sex to sell this product? Afterwards, they
explored how these categories cluster with each other, and found some
unique combinations such as ads that included both sex appeal and
animals.

There are different types of variables included in this dataset. 7 are
integers, including the `view_count`, `like_count`, `dislike_count`. 10
variables are characters, including `brand`, `title`, and `description`.
8 variable is a double variable, which is `year`. 7 variables are
logical, which shows either `TRUE` or `FALSE` for some categories,
including whether or not the ad is funny, patriotic, includes animals,
and includes sex. These logical variables were determined by the
FiveThirtyEight team as they watched all of the advertisements.

## Analysis plan
